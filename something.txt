I am a computer science student who likes trying new stuff. I was a complete amatuer last year but have now started using manjaro as my OS and vim as my text editor. I love playing chess and reading about greek mythology. The purpose of the blog is to not repeat myself and share my understanding and knowledge with everyone. Hoping it might spark an interest in someone. This will be a multitopic blog. Reading the blog might also be productive procrastination, but no promises. 

My name is Eeshaan Sarda. I am 17. I am a student. I was born and raised in Biratnagar, Nepal. I was lucky enough to have studied in the Scindia school and my luck does not run out as I am now studying Computer Science in the University of St Andrews. I love learning. I hate exams. Well, what are you waiting for? Go check out my blog or my projects!

Enjoy!

        <p>Hello! My name is Eeshaan and I am 18. I am a computer science student, finished up with my first year, who likes trying new stuff. I was a complete amatuer last year, and still mostly am, but have now started using manjaro as my OS and vim as my text editor. I love playing chess and reading about greek mythology (all right, i'm a nerd!). The purpose of the blog is to share my journey, understanding and knowledge (not so much) with everyone, hoping it might spark an interest in someone. This will be a multitopic blog. Reading the blog might also be productive procrastination, but no promises! </p>
        <p>Also I will not pretend to teach/tell stuff that people have already done in an excellent fashion. There will be a post called "Resources". Please check that out. It should be quite useful.</p>
